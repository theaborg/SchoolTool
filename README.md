# SchoolTool
This was a course project that I wrote with Petter Bj√∂rklund spring of 2022. 
SchoolTool simulates a school platform, where students and employees can log in to manage courses, studentgroups and so on. 
One of the more interesting parts of the project was experimenting with password encryption and file management. 
The GUI was *not* the focus of this project (as you can probably tell). We were both more interested in functionality!
